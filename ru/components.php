<UL>
	The interest of these components lies in the fact that it is not useful any more to conceive a Web site to draw part of the PHP possibilities and finally to display the result in a Web navigator. TPHP thus makes it possible to write Windows and Linux web-browser independent native applications giving a more professional aspect to Internet/Intranet oriented applications.<p>
	Several series of components are designed to cover about all the fields of the PHP. But the first series relates to the most significant share of the PHP:  the databases access.<p>
	This series of components names PHP Data Objects and includes the following components:<p>
	<UL>
		<LI>TPHPConnection,</LI>
		<LI>TPHPDataSet,</LI>
		<LI>TPHPGrid,</LI>
		<LI>TPHPComboBox,</LI>
		<LI>TPHPListBox.</LI><P>
	</UL>
	The TPHPConnection component is used to connect a database and a Web site on which are stored data processing PHP scripts. The TPHPDataSet component provides a SQL query which recovers the data from a SQL Server via PHP scripts and composes a ready-to-use recordset. The other components are used for displaying the recordsets; the list is not exhaustive, other display components must supplement this list.<p>
